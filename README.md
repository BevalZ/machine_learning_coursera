# machine_learning_coursera
This is the code for the coursera course for machine learning, written in Matlab/Octave.
The files corresponds to different algorithms for machine learning. The **machine-learning-ex** directories correspond to the homework of coursera course for machine learning taught by Professor Andrew Ng, and others correspond to the homework of CS229 course taught by Professor in Stanford. The algorithms include: linear regression; multivariate linear regression; regularized linear regression; locally weighted linear regression; logistic regreesion; multi-class logistic regression; forward propagation neural network; back propagation neural network; model selection(according to bias and variance).Optimization method include gradient descent and Newtonâ€™s method, and other complicated optimization methods.
Some of the codes need mathematical derivations, especially about the matrix calculus, but I will not give the derivation.
