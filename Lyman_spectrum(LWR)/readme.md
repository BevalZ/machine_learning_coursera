## Introduction
This files of codes correspond to the No.5 problem for machine learning in Stanford cs229(Autumn 2016), the main algorithm used here are locally weighted linear regression(LWR) to smooth the data and then functional regression to fit a function.
The **ps1.pdf** is the problem set, and the **ps1_key.pdf** is the corresponding answer, and these code corresponds to the 5th problem. All codes are written in Matlab(also can be run on Octave).
- The **fishsort.m** is a useful function I wrote for getting the biggest/smallest n - numbers and their index.
- Two csv files are training set and test set.
- The **gothrough** is the code I wrote for run the LWR sequences.
- The **lwr** code is the code I wrote for doing LWR.
- The two **local_linear_regression** files are “standard answers” provided by Stanford.
